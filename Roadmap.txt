Here's a step-by-step roadmap to learn React for professional development:  

---

 Phase 1: Prerequisites (1-2 Weeks)
Before diving into React, ensure you have a solid understanding of:  
- HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap/Tailwind (Styling)  
- JavaScript (ES6+):  
  - Let/const, Template literals  
  - Arrow functions, Destructuring  
  - Spread/rest operators, Async/await  
  - Promises, Fetch API  
- Basic Git/GitHub for version control  
- Node.js & npm for package management  

---

 Phase 2: React Basics (2-3 Weeks)
 1. Setting Up the Environment  
- Install Node.js & npm  
- Create a React project using Vite or Create React App  
- Understand JSX (JavaScript XML)  

 2. Components & Props  
- Functional vs Class Components  
- Passing and receiving props  
- Conditional Rendering  

 3. State & Events  
- `useState` for state management  
- Handling onClick, onChange, onSubmit events  

 4. Lists & Keys  
- Rendering lists dynamically  
- Understanding key props  

---

 Phase 3: Intermediate React (3-4 Weeks)
 1. React Hooks  
- `useEffect` for side effects (API calls, event listeners)  
- `useContext` for global state management  

 2. React Router  
- Install and use React Router  
- Define Routes, `useNavigate`, `useParams`  
- Protect routes with authentication  

 3. API Integration  
- Fetch data using Axios or Fetch API  
- Handle loading and errors  
- Use environment variables (`.env`)  

---

 Phase 4: Advanced React (4-5 Weeks)
 1. State Management  
- Understand `useReducer`  
- Learn Redux Toolkit for global state  
- Use `Context API` effectively  

 2. Performance Optimization  
- React.memo, `useCallback`, `useMemo`  
- Code splitting & Lazy loading (`React.lazy`)  

 3. Forms Handling  
- Controlled & Uncontrolled components  
- Form validation with Formik & Yup  

---

 Phase 5: Building Real Projects (Ongoing)
 1. Project Ideas  
- Todo App (State & Props)  
- Weather App (API integration)  
- E-commerce Website (Routing, Authentication, Redux)  
- Portfolio Website  

 2. Deployment  
- Use Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages  
- Deploy a backend (Spring Boot) with Render, Railway, or AWS  

---

 Phase 6: Mastering Full-Stack Development
- Learn React with Spring Boot (Java) for full-stack  
- Use Docker, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)  
- Understand Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)  

---

 Final Goal: Apply for Jobs & Contribute to Open Source
- Build a portfolio website  
- Contribute to GitHub open-source projects  
- Prepare for React interviews (DSA, System Design, React Patterns)
